          <h4><strong>How does Covid-19 Affect our small businesses and how we can help them</strong></h4>
          <br>
          <p>
            As we are still experiencing the effects of the seemingly Covid-19 world pandemic less and less people are going out and only if necessary, since most of the basic necessities and commodities can already be ordered online at the convenience of their own home. For this reason, a lot of businesses have to cope up and are force to transition and expand their traditional business online. Otherwise they will suffer greatly as they lose more and more walk-in customers thus also their income and eventually will result to bankruptcy or closure of their business.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p> 
            But for those who strive, the process through which this transition or the need to adapt is not always smooth sailing. There are so many things to consider and learn in areas of Digital and Social Media Marketing, Branding, Web Design, Web Development, Application Development, Marketing and Advertising and the likes. It takes a lot of personal study and learning curve, time, money and other resources to be able to come up with a substantial product or strategy that will establish your business online. 
          </p>
          <br>
            <p> But since the information technology has progressed a lot through the years. There are already different platforms and ways that these businesses can adapt to these changes by using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube and the likes. Some use paid platforms such as Wix, Squarespace, Weebly and Shopify. And others with more knowledge uses free platforms such as Wordpress. There are also those who choose to have their own platforms through custom built personal blogs, company websites or e-commerce stores specially tailored for their business needs but this approach could cost more or need more expert knowledge and expertise.  
            <br>
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>A lot of startups and small businesses we have talked to who would like to start or transition their businesses online are pointing to below common challenges
           <br>
           <br>
            <ul>
            <li>How do I create my own brand logo?</li>
            <br>
            <li>What color themes am I going to use for my brand?</li>
            <br>
            <li>What social media platforms should I utilize?</li>
            <br>
            <li>Do I need to have my own business website, if yes how can I create one?</li>
            <br>
            <li>How much does implementing and maintaining my business online cost?</li>
            <br>
            <li>How can they I improve business process such as to allow my customers’ to have an easy way to order online?</li>
            
            
          </ul>
          </p>
          <br> 
          <p> These problems can best be solved if one has enough knowledge and experiences in the different areas that we mentioned above. And by the time these startups and small businesses have learned these things and come up with a minimum viable product, they have already lost a lot of opportunities to showcase their products to their customers. Another option is to hire subject matter experts to help business do it for them but this may be a bit expensive initially but would be beneficial in the long run.
          </p>
          <br>
            <p>  It is for this reason and mission we would like to help our clients. To help them through our knowledge, experience, and expertise to come up with strategies, solutions, and implementations that will solve their challenges in trying to put, establish and or expand their business online. From consultation until delivery, we will guide these businesses every step of the way as if their business is also our own so that we can help them realize their maximum business potentials.
          </p>
          <br>
            <p>  If you are a freelancer, marketer, influencer, entrepreneur, or small business owner who would like to take the next steps but aren’t sure where or how to get started, you may send as an email so we can discuss with you how we can be of help.
